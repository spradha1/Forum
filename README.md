# ForReal?

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The project aims to create a simple forum app with a 'PER' (Postgres, Express, React) approach. The frontend code in React is available in the repository. It is currently in progress and any comments for improvement are appreciated. I will be happy to respond.

## Installation and Execution

I have to mention that you have to setup your backend code to make this work with the frontend. I plan to deploy it soon and make it nice and pretty for everybody to see. For now it is just the code that you might have to work with to see what it looks like.  

Being a node.js project, you know the usual way to do this. Download or clone the project and run 

`npm install`  

Then run it using  

`npm start`
